	<h2>SpaceX and Their Plan</h2>

	<p>SpaceX has plans to accomplis a Mars Colony by 2028. They have a planned luner mission for 2023. Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX wants plans to move pretty quickly. He already launched the Falcon Heavy earlier this year and plans to use an even bigger rocket for the Mars colonization. The BFR, which he plans to make the biggest rocket to ever exist, is the one that will fly to Mars.</p>

	<p>The estimated cost of sending one person to Mars will be 10 million dollar. The idea for SpaceX is to try and get this as low as possible. That is why SpaceX has dedicated a lot of effort into making parts of their rockets reusable.</p>

	<h2>The Colony</h2>

	<p>The colony is set to be a reality by 2028. While the colony will not be fully established and at its full potential, it will still include various people. The idea is to send scientist first, people who will know how to survive in those environments. After that is set and teh colony knows how to grow their own food and water, they can send volunteers. There have already been thousands of volunteers that want to be sent to Mars. The problem? There isn't a way for them to get back yet.</p>
